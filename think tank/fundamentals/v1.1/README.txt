    - This program is the second iteration of Andrew Canaan and Alex Brennan's stock screening prototype. 
    - It will prompt the user for which criteria it would like to screen with, as well as whether the user
    wants to generate excel sheets.
    - The following are loose requirements for a V1 prototype:
            1. Market Cap CHECK

            2. Current Price CHECK

            3. Volume CHECK

            4. Dividends Y/N CHECK (DIVIDEND DATE AND EX DIVIDEND DATE)

            5. Earnings Per Share CHECK (CURRENT AND PER FISCAL YEAR)

            6. Price to Earnings Ratio CHECK

            7. Price to Earnings to Growth Ratio CHECK 

            8. Beta CHECK


            Recommend against these for now.
            
            9. Sector CHECK

            10. Industry CHECK
