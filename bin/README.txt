    - This program is the second iteration of Andrew Canaan's stock screening prototype. 
    - It will prompt the user for which criteria it would like to screen with, as well as whether the user
    wants to generate excel sheets.
    - The following are loose requirements for a V1 prototype:
            1. Market Cap CHECK - Company Overview.xlsx

            2. Current Price CHECK - Daily Price xlsx

            3. Volume CHECK - Daily Price xlsx

            4. Dividends Y/N CHECK (DIVIDEND DATE AND EX DIVIDEND DATE) - Company Overview xlsx

            5. Earnings Per Share CHECK (CURRENT AND PER FISCAL YEAR) - quarterly/annual earnings xlsx 
            
            6. Price to Earnings Ratio CHECK - Company Overview xlsx (PERatio)

            7. Price to Earnings to Growth Ratio CHECK - Company Overview xlsx (PERatio)

            8. Beta CHECK - Company Overview xlsx (PERatio)


            Recommend against these for now.
            
            9. Sector CHECK
